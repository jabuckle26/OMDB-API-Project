# OMDB-API-Project

This project was created to practice interacting with a RESTful API, using TypeScript. Other concepts practiced during this project included JavaScript array maniputlation and HTML DOM interactions.

The Online Movie Database (OMDB) is fetched in JavaScript and film posters are returned to the user. Films can be searched for and filtered by year. Films can be added to favourites, which are stored until the user refreshes the page. 

Styling was not the main goal of the project but future updates will be made to the website style, to allow responsiveness and compatibility with mobile devices.

Before modifications are made to this project, a yarn install or npm install must be run.
